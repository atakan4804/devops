# Lecture 1 at 5th Semptember 2025

## TODOS:

The lecturer presented the topic/project, and then we created some of the prerequisites for the DEVOPS Project.

1. Create Project in Spring Initializer
2. Create for each project member a GitHub Account
3. Add private/public key for the project, so the CI/CD pipeline will work
4. Add project to GitHub

The first lecture was quite easy, and we completed it at a fast pace, so we could leave earlier home.
